If {@link IShoppingCartCommodity.ICreate.accumulate} has `true` value

then new commodity would not be created but the volume would be accumulated.

### Describe
  - shoppings_customers_carts_commodities_create

> The function call to create a new commodity in the shopping cart resulted in an error. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what happened:
> 
> ### Function Call Explanation
> The intention was to create a new commodity within a shopping cart, specifically for a sale identified by `macbook_sale_uuid`. The request included the following key components:
> - **sale_id**: This identifies the specific sale from which the commodity is being created.
> - **stocks**: An array that details the stocks being purchased, including their unique identifiers (`unit_id` and `stock_id`).
> - **volume**: Indicates how many sets of this commodity are intended to be purchased.
> 
> ### Error Details
> The function returned a HTTP status code of `400` (Bad Request). This indicates that there was an issue with the request data. The error messages provided a clear insight into the following discrepancies:
> 
> 1. **sale_id**: The expected type was a string formatted as a UUID, but the provided value `macbook_sale_uuid` did not adhere to this requirement.
> 
> 2. **stocks[0].unit_id**: Similar to the `sale_id`, the `unit_id` also required a UUID format, yet `macbook_unit_uuid` was given which did not fit the expected format.
> 
> 3. **stocks[0].stock_id**: The same issue persists here where the `stock_id` was expected to be a UUID formatted string, and `macbook_most_expensive_stock_uuid` was rejected for not being in the proper format.
> 
> ### Summary
> The attempt to create a shopping cart commodity was unsuccessful due to incorrect data types and formatting for essential identifiers. Proper UUID values need to be supplied for the identifiers to successfully complete the request for adding a commodity.
