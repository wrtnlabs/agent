This happened within the `findFirstOrThrow()` invocation on the backend, suggesting that there are either no records that match the provided ID or that it has been deleted or is otherwise unavailable.
> 
> ### Explanation of 404 Status
> The 404 Not Found error signifies that the requested resource (in this case, the sale record) does not exist in the database. The underlying cause can be one of the following:
> - The sale might have been removed or marked as inactive.
> - The provided ID might have been typed incorrectly.
> - The sale record may never have existed, possibly due to an error in the creation process.
> 
> ### What to Do Next?
> If you believe this ID should exist and you are still interested in the details of the sale, consider the following actions:
> 1. **Verify the Sale ID:** Double-check the format and accuracy of the provided sale ID.
> 2. **Check Availability:** If you have access, consult the system or database directly to see the current list of sale records.
> 3. **Try a Different Query:** If applicable, you may want to search for sales without a specific ID, or look for other sale identifiers.

### Describe
  - shoppings_customers_orders_create

> The function call you attempted to make was intended to create a new order application from a shopping cart composed by the customer. However, it resulted in an internal server error (status code 500). Here’s an overview of what this function is supposed to accomplish and the reason for the failure:
> 
> ## Overview of the Function
> 
> The `shoppings_customers_orders_create` function is designed to create a new order application, which is classified in the following steps:
> 
> 1. **Input Parameters**:
>    - **body**: Contains the creation information for the order application.
>      - **goods**: This is a list of goods included in the order. The customer can select which items from their shopping cart they wish to include in the order.
>      - **name**: An optional field that can specify a representative name for the order.
> 
> 2. **Process Flow**:
>    - When the function is called, it verifies the goods listed in the shopping cart. Not all items in the cart must be included, as the customer may choose a selection of commodities to purchase.
>    - By creating the order application, it does not confirm or complete the order immediately. The order becomes completed only when the customer proceeds to payment, which is distinctly handled in the `IShoppingOrderPublish`.
> 
> 3. **Expected Output**:
>    - If successful, the function should return information about the newly created order application, including its unique identifier, representative name, customer information, and a detailed list of goods.
> 
> ### Error Encountered
> 
> Despite the intended operations, the function returned a status code of 500, indicating an internal server error. This could be due to various reasons such as:
> 
> - Issues within the server's code or logic.
> - Problems with the data sent in the request, such as missing required fields.
> - Temporary server outages or database connection issues.
> 
> ### Troubleshooting Steps
> 
> If this error persists, consider the following troubleshooting steps:
> 
> 1. **Check Input Data**:
>    - Ensure that the `goods` list is not empty and adheres to the expected format.

### Cancel
#### shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create
  - controller: shopping
  - function: shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create
  - reason: complete

Publish an order.

{@link IShoppingOrderPublish Publish} an {@link IShoppingOrder order} that
has been applied by the {@link IShoppingCustomer} with
{@link IShoppingAddress address} to delivery and payment information gotten
from the payment vendor system.

If the order has been discounted for entire order price, then no need
to send payment vendor info. Instead, only address info is required.

Also, the payment time can be different with the publish time. For example,
if the payment method is manual bank account transfer, then the payment
would be delayed until the customer actually transfer the money. In that
case, {@link IShoppingOrderPublish.paid_at} would be `null` value, so
that you have to check it after calling this publish function.

### Text (assistant)
To assist you properly, I first need to gather the details about the available sales in the shopping mall and the detailed information about the MacBook. Let's start with that.

Please hold on a moment while I fetch that information.

### Describe
  - shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create

> The function call to publish an order with the specified order ID and address details resulted in an error due to an issue with the mobile number format provided. Below is a detailed breakdown of the response:
> 
> ### Response Overview
> 
> - **Status:** 400 (Bad Request)
> - **Error Message:** "Request body data is not following the promised type."
> 
> ### Error Details
> 
> The error response includes specific information about the validation that failed for the mobile number:
> 
> - **Path:** `$input.address.mobile`
> - **Expected Type:** `string & Pattern<"^[0-9]*$">`
> - **Provided Value:** `"010-1234-5678"`
> 
> ### Explanation
> 
> The expected format for the mobile number is a string consisting solely of digits, matching the regular expression pattern `^[0-9]*$`, which means it should only contain numbers without any additional characters like hyphens or spaces. However, the provided mobile number `"010-1234-5678"` includes hyphens, which leads to the format validation failure.
> 
> ### Recommended Action
> 
> To correct this issue, the mobile number should be provided in a format that only includes digits. For example, the mobile number should be reformatted as follows:
> 
> - **Correct Format:** `"01012345678"`
> 
> By ensuring that the mobile number strictly contains numbers, the request to publish the order can be successfully processed without encountering the aforementioned error.
>
