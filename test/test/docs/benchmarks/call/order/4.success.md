> - **Status Code**: 404
> - **Message**: The operation failed because it depended on one or more records that were required but not found. Specifically, when attempting to retrieve a sale record using the method `ShoppingGlobal.prisma.shopping_sales.findFirstOrThrow()`, no matching records were found.
> - **Description of the Error**:
>   - This error indicates an issue with retrieving the required sale record from the database. It suggests that either the `sale_id` provided does not correspond to any existing sale or that the sale has been removed or is not accessible due to various reasons, such as being suspended or closed.
> 
> ### Recommended Actions
> 1. **Verify Sale ID**: Double-check the `sale_id` being used in the request to ensure it is correct and corresponds to a valid sale entry in the database.
> 2. **Check Sale Status**: Investigate the status of the sale to confirm that it is not suspended, closed, or otherwise unavailable for transactions.
> 3. **Database Integrity**: Ensure that the database has maintained integrity and that the expected records are present. If necessary, consult database logs for any recent changes that might affect the visibility of sale records.

> 
> 3. **Error Response**:
>    - **Status Code**: 500
>    - **Message**: "Internal server error"

> Unfortunately, the order could not be created due to this server error. To further investigate the issue, reviewing server logs or applying error handling in the code would be beneficial. If there are specific details regarding the input items or system state when the error occurred, checking those details might also provide clues for resolution.

### Cancel
#### shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create
  - controller: shopping
  - function: shoppings_customers_orders_publish_create
  - reason: complete

Publish an order.

{@link IShoppingOrderPublish Publish} an {@link IShoppingOrder order} that
has been applied by the {@link IShoppingCustomer} with
{@link IShoppingAddress address} to delivery and payment information gotten
from the payment vendor system.

If the order has been discounted for entire order price, then no need
to send payment vendor info. Instead, only address info is required.

Also, the payment time can be different with the publish time. For example,
if the payment method is manual bank account transfer, then the payment
would be delayed until the customer actually transfer the money. In that
case, {@link IShoppingOrderPublish.paid_at} would be `null` value, so
that you have to check it after calling this publish function.
